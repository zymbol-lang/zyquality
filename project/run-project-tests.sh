# run-project-tests.sh — every real-program test in the workspace.
#
# The corpus proves the language works on test cases. This proves it
# works on the programs actually written in it: a go engine, two TUI games, a
# neural-network library, a code auditor, the web playground.
#
# Usage: bash project/run-project-tests.sh [OPTIONS]      (from zyquality/)
#
#   --engine PATH   Interpreter under test (default: zymbol on PATH)
#   --vm            Also run what supports it through the register VM
#   --go LEVEL      AI-vs-AI go tournaments: none | quick | full   (default: none)
#                     quick = 1 game per board — does a game complete at all
#                     full  = 100x 9x9, 50x 13x13, 20x 19x19 — how well it plays
#   --only NAMES    Comma-separated subset: go,serpiente,klingon,zofia,zyaudit,web
#   -h, --help
#
# The project runners all invoke `zymbol` from PATH, so --engine works by
# putting a symlink of that name first on PATH — no runner needs changing, and
# the same command can therefore test a packaged binary:
#
#   bash project/run-project-tests.sh --engine /usr/bin/zymbol
#
# Two kinds of suite, and the difference matters
# ----------------------------------------------
# Most suites here judge the *interpreter*: point them at a binary and a failure
# means that binary is wrong. The `web` suites do not. They judge
# web/src/zymbol/zymbol.js, the hand-written JavaScript mirror that runs the
# playground — code that ships in no package at all. `test_runner.mjs` does
# invoke the CLI, but only as the reference to compare the mirror against, and
# it currently carries five known mirror gaps (IMPL_V008.md § E.3).
#
# So `--engine` selects the interpreter suites only, and skips `web` with a note:
# validating a .deb should never go red over browser debt. `--only web` still
# runs them explicitly when that is what you want.
#
# Exit 0 only when every selected suite passed.

# --- GO tournaments ---------------------------------------------------------

# through the VM, and the reason `full` is a coffee break rather than a weekend:
#
#            tree-walker      VM     ratio

#   19x19        825s         38s      22x
#
# So `--go full --vm` is ~20 minutes and `--go full` on the tree-walker is ~8
# hours. The engine flag follows --vm.
#
